# Greenstack's Game Stats
A simple, lightweight library that contains a bunch of classes to manage game character stats.

## Installation
The simplest way to do this is to copy the `src/Stats.cs` file into your project. Alternatively,
you can clone the repository as a submodule into your project and add a reference to the game
stats project.
