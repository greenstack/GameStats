# Greenstack's Game Stats
A simple, lightweight library that contains a bunch of classes to manage game character stats.

## Installation
There are three ways to include GameStats in your project:
1. Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Greenstack.GameStats/): `dotnet add package Greenstack.GameStats --version 1.0.0`
2. Clone the repository as a submodule into your project. This will let you have the most up-to-date sources.
3. Copy `src/Stats.cs` to an appropriate location in your project. While you won't get updates, it does reduce the number of dlls that will be produced in a project build.
